datatype mytype = OneInt of int | Pizza;

val something = Pizza;
(* Now let's try treating Pizza as a function with zero args *)
(* val something_else = Pizza (); *)
(* Can't do the above since they are values not functions like constructors that take args *)

(* fun f x = *)
(*     case x of *)
(* 	Pizza => "hello" *)
